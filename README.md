Files for the Airwolf3D Axiom printer

Someone gave me an old, used Airwolf3D Axiom printer in late 2023. Airwolf3D no longer manufactures or supports this printer. Some of the parts are 3d printed, including the Bowden extruder, and there are no STL files available for them. Newer slicing software does not support this printer, so some configuration is needed to use. This is a collection of files and information I had to gather from multiple sources or reverse engineer to get this printer working.
