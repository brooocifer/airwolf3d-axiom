# Cura Ultimaker Pro

I don't have Airwolf3D's APEX software, and I have absolutely no interest in it. I've been using Cura Ultimaker Pro for years so why change now?

Except that Cura supports practically every 3D printer manufacturer except Airwolf3D. Or maybe Airwolf3D doesn't want Cura to support them, since they have competing software.

Either way, it takes manually setting up Cura to use it.

I'm not finding a HOWTO article for this EOL'd printer, but there are articles on Airwolf3D's currently supported printers, so working through it right now.

I also have the sample print files, so some reverse engineering will need to occur.

I've tried to use parts of the sample print files for GCODE start and end scripts, but it still isn't working. It's like the printer is trying to print 0.5mm too high above the glass plate.

Stay tuned.
