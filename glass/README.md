# Glass

There was no glass plate in the printer when I received it, a detail I didn't notice until I tried my first test print and the print head started dropping ABS from a few millimeters too high!

Luckily the Axiom printer shares the same glass plate dimensions as some of Airwolf3D's other still supported printers. 

Replacement parts are available at: https://airwolf3d.com/product-category/3d-printer-replacement-parts/.

I ordered the "AXIOM and EVOR Double Sided FLEX-RESISTANT GLASS" for $45.00, along with a bottle of Wolfbite Original from https://airwolf3d.com/product-category/3d-printer-adhesive/.

I ordered about 2 weeks before Christmas, it took Airwolf3D 15 calendar days to fulfill my order, and they shipped it via UPS Ground the day after Christmas. I'm only 2 states away (a 6 hour drive) away from their location, so it was delivered 2 days later.

The Wolfbite application was quick and simple (see the video at the next link), installation was easy (https://airwolf3d.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/13000048097-axiom-single-bowden-installing-glass-plate).

I'm really pleased with how well the printed models stick to the plate during printing, and how easily they detach from the cool plate.

Success! For only $77.82 (includes shipping and taxes)
