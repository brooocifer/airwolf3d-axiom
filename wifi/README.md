# Wi-Fi

I didn't realize this printer had Wi-Fi until I was looking through the support files. There are two main articles of interest:

- AXIOM/AXIOMe Enable the hotspot: https://airwolf3d.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/13000000433-axiom-axiome-enable-the-hotspot-
- AXIOM Single Bowden - Wolfbox - Connecting to the Printer: https://airwolf3d.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/5000663358-axiom-single-bowden-wolfbox-connecting-to-the-printer

I ran through the second article, and was happy to see that the hotspot was available. I create an Astroprint account, then connected to it from my iPhone, it took a really long time to connect. Once connected, the setup went exactly as documented, until step 7.

When I clicked on "Printer Connection", I got an error that it couldn't connect to astroprint.com. I realized that it hadn't connected to my Wi-Fi as expected, so no Internet was available.

I skipped this step, and completed the wizard. But the hotspot never turned off, and I don't see the printer in my account at astroprint.com. 

Stay tuned.

And one small gripe - https://astroprint.com has a certificate error because they use a wildcard cert. https://www.astroprint.com works just fine though. Hey Astroprint! it's 2024, configure redirection correctly! No one types out "www" anymore!
